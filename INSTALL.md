## Installation

### Requirements
- Linux or macOS with Python ≥ 3.8
- PyTorch ≥ 1.13 is recommended and [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/) that matches the PyTorch installation.
  Install them together at [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org) to make sure of this. Note, please check
  PyTorch version matches that is required by Detectron2.
- Detectron2: follow [Detectron2 installation instructions](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/tutorials/install.html).
- OpenCV is optional but needed by demo and visualization
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

An example of installation is shown below:

```
git clone https://github.com/KU-CVLAB/CAT-Seg.git
cd CAT-Seg
conda create -n catseg python=3.8
conda activate catseg
conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
